1. Setting up vagrant

sudo dnf install vagrant
mkdir vagrant
cd vagrant
vagrant up					//Can throw an error. So do the following

vagrant box add ubuntu/focal64			//You can choose another distribution similarly
vagrant up

2. Setting up Ngnix in Redhat based distros

sudo dnf install ngnix
sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/sites-available		//In debain based distro, we have this folder by default
sudo mkdri /etc/nginx/sites-enabled		//"	"	"	"	"	"	"
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf			//Edit the http block and the line below:

include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;		

[Note: all files will be inside "sites-available" and we've to create symlink inside sites enabled]

3. Setup Docker

sudo dnf install moby-engine			//weird
sudo docker login				//optional
sudo docker pull <distro>:<version>		//Will install distro.	ex: sudo docker pull ubuntu:20.04
sudo docker run -it <distro>			//Will run the distro.	ex: sudo docker run -it ubuntu
exit						//Will close container.
sudo docker attach <container_id>		//Will link two or more terminal running same docker

[Note: docker image uses the same kernel which host OS has. Distros which run inside docker container doesn't have its own kernel.]

4. Keep a log of command you type

script						//will start recording commands
exit						//will stop recording commands

[Start-Transcript and Stop-Transcript is command-line tools that can be used in Windows.]
