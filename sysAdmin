#A good admin support both Windows and Linux user simulatenously. Even though it sound like the task is assigned for "IT-support".

1. Setting up vagrant

sudo dnf install vagrant
mkdir vagrant
cd vagrant
vagrant box add ubuntu/focal64			//You can choose another distribution similarly
vagrant up					//Vagarnt sucks for some reason.

2. Setting up Ngnix in Redhat based distros

sudo dnf install ngnix
sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/sites-available		//In debain based distro, we have this folder by default
sudo mkdri /etc/nginx/sites-enabled		//"	"	"	"	"	"	"
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf			//Edit the http block and the line below:

include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;		

[Note: all files will be inside "sites-available" and we've to create symlink inside sites enabled]

3. Setup Docker					// Don't use Docker when Podman exist.

sudo dnf install moby-engine			//weird
sudo docker login				//optional
sudo docker pull <distro>:<version>		//Will install distro.	ex: sudo docker pull ubuntu:20.04
sudo docker run -it <distro>			//Will run the distro.	ex: sudo docker run -it ubuntu
exit						//Will close container.
sudo docker attach <container_id>		//Will link two or more terminal running same docker

[Note: Docker image uses the same kernel which host OS has. Distros which run inside docker container doesn't have its own kernel.]
[Note: Since docker requires root permission to do things, rather use Podman which is compatible to almost all Docker command.]

4. Keep a log of command you type

script						//will start recording commands
exit						//will stop recording commands

[Start-Transcript and Stop-Transcript is command-line tools that can be used in Windows.]

5. Make a SSH connection to a computer if you have login credentials

ssh <username>@<ip> -p <>		//example: ssh ubuntu@13.126.30.126 -p 22

[For more: curl cht.sh/ssh]

6. Setup MySQL

sudo dnf install community-mysql-common				//"common" will install all necessary packages
sudo systemctl start mysqld					//Optional
mysql_secure_installation					//Setup root password, previleges, etc.
create user 'pranav'@'localhost' identified by 'bhattarai'	//will create mysql user named "pranav" with password named "bhattarai"
mysql -u <username> -p						//Try to avoid using "sudo" in any mysql command
	
[MariaDB is a great fork of MySQL which provides all advance features. So learn MariaDB instead, or even better learn PostgreSQL.]

7. Head, Tail & Tailf command to see logs

head -4 /path/to/log		// to see 4 log entries from the beginning
tail -5 /path/to/log		// to see 5 log entries form the ending
tailf /path/to/log		// to see realtime change in log

[For more: curl cht.sh/<command>]

`````````````````````````````````

8. Indentifying network loss/drop

mtr google.com			//mtr is an opensource utility tool which merges the functionality of 'traceroute' & 'ping'.

[For more: curl cht.sh/mtr]

``````````````````````````````````

10. Watch the command

watch ls			//See realtime change in new files/folder being created since "watch" will refresh at every 2 sec.

[Watch will work with almost any other command. Just type 'watch' before the command.]

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

11. Create a password for Windows users.

	net user pranav *				// give u more privacy if someone is looking at your screen
or
	net user pranav 'write-password-here'		// give u less privacy since they can see what you are typing

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

12. Force/Let Windows user to change their password when they log on

net user pranav /logonpasswordchg:yes			// admin shouldn't know other users' password. #Privacy

[helpful when new emplyoee (say, pranav) joins the company. Admin need to create a new user profile for him to use.]

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

13. Create a new user in Windows

	net user pranav * /add
or,
	net user pranav #007#007 /add /logonpasswordchg:yes	// Create a new user with temporary password which need to change later

[here, #007#007 is a temporary password. And pranav is the username of the user.]
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

14. Delete the user profile in Windows

	net user pranav /del		// will delete Windows user named "pranav"
or
	remove-localuser pranav

[Note: If you want GUI to create & manage user account, then go: Computer Management > Local User and Groups > Users]

15. Get all Windows user info

get-localuser

14.
