# Linux101
Clean and maintaing my Linux distro.
I usually prefer non-LTS Ubuntu as my daily driver.

These are some commands that I used to makes things work.
This is a backup if incase it gets lost.

My fav custom shortkey are:
Super + A = Close the Window
Super + B = Open the Browser
Super + W = Open the Terminal
Super + Z = Minimize all Window
Super + D = Open file manager
Super + R = Record screen
Super + 1 = Workspace 1
Super + 2 = Workspace 2

Ctrl + Alt + Shift + P = Shutdown
