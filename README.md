# Linux101
This repo is my way to clean and maintain my Linux distro. <br>
I usually prefer non-LTS Ubuntu as my daily driver.<br><br>

These are some commands that I used to makes things work.
This is a <b><i>just<i><b> backup if incase it gets lost.


<b>My fav custom shortkey are:</b><br>
Super + A = Close the Window<br>
Super + B = Open the Browser<br>
Super + W = Open the Terminal<br>
Super + Z = Minimize all Window<br>
Super + D = Open file manager<br>
Super + R = Record screen<br>
Super + 1 = Workspace 1<br>
Super + 2 = Workspace 2<br><br>

Shift + Ctrl + Super + P = Shutdown
