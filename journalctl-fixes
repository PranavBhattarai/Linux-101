#Filter error log from normal logs
journalctl -b -p 3			//b means last boot. p means priority. 3 means errors.
journalctl -b --unit=<unit-name>	//example: journalctl -b --unit=wpa_supplient
journalctl -b -u <package-name>		//example: journalctl -u NetworkManager. Here "-u" represent unit name of a program
journalctl -b -k			// -k to include dmseg log
journalctl -ef				//to see log entries in realtime
journalctl -p err			//priotize error logs
journalctl -fo cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell	//grab all gnome-shell warnings/bugs/errors
dmesg > /path/to/location		//For reporting. Sames goes to Journalctl commands.

journalctl --verify			//if this command output shows "fail", then only two run command listed below
sudo journalctl --flush --rotate	//WARNING: will remove all logs
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=1s	//WARNING: will remove all logs

#Analyze slowdown of booting
systemd-analyze critical-chain		//is the one we have to see
systemd-analyze blame			//blame doesn't always impact boot-time. Because some of them executed asychronously.

1. Fixing VMware libssl and libcrypto issues by linking their locations

ldd /usr/sbin/vmware-authdlauncher	//Diagnose the package issue
cd /etc/ld.so.conf.d			//Create a ld.config file for vmware-authdlauncher
sudo touch vmware-authdlauncher.conf
nano vmware-authdlauncher.conf		//Write two lines written below and save and exit the file.
/usr/lib/vmware/lib/libssl.so.1.0.2	//write same libssl.so version which u see inside /usr/bin/vmware/lib
/usr/lib/vmware/lib/libcryto.so.1.0.2	//write same libcryto.so version which u see inside /usr/bin/vmware/lib
sudo ldconfig				//A command to update ldconfig configurations and take action
ldd /usr/sbin/vmware-authdlauncher	//See if the get the same error or not. 

Restart the system. Now you won't see error logs about them in GNOME Logs.


2. systemd-udevd: could not read from '/sys/module/pcc_cpufreq/initstate': No such device

intel_pstate=active			//Worked for some reason.


3. Contribute by sending hardware details	[Warning: Privacy will be compromised]

sudo hw-probe -all
cd /root/HW_PROBE/LATEST/hw.info		//See what you are going to upload
hw-probe -upload
sudo -E hw-probe -all -upload			// Even better


4. Share your journalctl log to dev through terminal

journalctl -xe | fpaste				// send the link you get in community

[If that log is not enough, you need to share entire log]

journalctl -x -b 0 > pranav.txt			// share/upload the file in community


5. PAM module looking for "fingerprint" authentication even when there is so hardware capability.

sudo authselect disable-feature with-fingerprint	// this command will stop unneccessary logs from appearing about fingerprint


6. VMWare not starting due to "failed to install vmware neccessary kernel module"		//A persistant issue since linux 5.17

sudo CPATH=/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/12/include/ vmware-modconfig --console --install-all	//Works perfectly on Fedora 36

[Don't use VMware or VirtualBox. Instead use Virt-Manager which is much more advance and its free & opensource.]


7. Track a buggy touchpad

sudo libinput debug-events --set-click-method=clickfinger

[part from "clickfinger", there're other modes u can look into to indentify if the problem u are facing is hardware issue or software/fimrware issue.]
