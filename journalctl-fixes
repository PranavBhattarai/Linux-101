#Filter error log from normal logs
journalctl -b -p 3			//b means last boot. p means priority. 3 means errors.
journalctl -b --unit=<unit-name>	//example: journalctl -b --unit=wpa_supplient
journalctl -b -u <package-name>		//example: journalctl -u NetworkManager
jounralctl -b -k			// -k to include dmseg log 
dmesg > /path/to/location		//For reporting. Sames goes to Journalctl commands.

journalctl --verify			//if this command output shows "fail", then only two run command listed below
sudo journalctl --flush --rotate	//WARNING: will remove all logs
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=1s	//WARNING: will remove all logs

#Analyze slowdown of booting
systemd-analyze critical-chain		//is the one we have to see
systemd-analyze blame			//blame doesn't always impact boot-time. Because some of them executed asychronously.

1. Fixing VMware libssl and libcrypto issues by linking their locations

ldd /usr/sbin/vmware-authdlauncher	//Diagnose the package issue
cd /etc/ld.so.conf.d			//Create a ld.config file for vmware-authdlauncher
sudo touch vmware-authdlauncher.conf
nano vmware-authdlauncher.conf		//Write two lines written below and save and exit the file.
/usr/lib/vmware/lib/libssl.so.1.0.2	//write same libssl.so version which u see inside /usr/bin/vmware/lib
/usr/lib/vmware/lib/libcryto.so.1.0.2	//write same libcryto.so version which u see inside /usr/bin/vmware/lib
sudo ldconfig				//A command to update ldconfig configurations and take action
ldd /usr/sbin/vmware-authdlauncher	//See if the get the same error or not. 

Restart the system. Now you won't see error logs about them in GNOME Logs.

2. systemd-udevd: could not read from '/sys/module/pcc_cpufreq/initstate': No such device

intel_pstate=active			//Worked for some reason.
