1. Fixing VMware libssl and libcrypto issues by linking their locations

ldd /usr/sbin/vmware-authdlauncher	//Diagnose the package issue
cd /etc/ld.so.conf.d			//Create a ld.config file for vmware-authdlauncher
sudo touch vmware-authdlauncher.conf
nano vmware-authdlauncher.conf		//Write two lines written below and save and exit the file.
/usr/lib/vmware/lib/libssl.so.1.0.2	//write same libssl.so version which u see inside /usr/bin/vmware/lib
/usr/lib/vmware/lib/libcryto.so.1.0.2	//write same libcryto.so version which u see inside /usr/bin/vmware/lib
sudo ldconfig				//A command to update ldconfig configurations and take action
ldd /usr/sbin/vmware-authdlauncher	//See if the get the same error or not. 

Restart the system. Now you won't see error logs about them in GNOME Logs.

2. systemd-udevd: could not read from '/sys/module/pcc_cpufreq/initstate': No such device

intel_pstate=active			//Worked for some reason.
