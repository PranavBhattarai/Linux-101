sudo adduser pragya	//to add a new user
sudo passwd pragya	//need to have the password inorder to use, I guess

// Note: new user can't run 'sudo' commands with elevated privileges by default.
// Any such attempts are reported in log for administrative user to see.
// We could add Pragya to a group that is pre-defined, to able to use sudo to
// do anything as root - but we don't want to give such super power to Pragya, do we?

whoami		//see which user I am currently
su - pragya	//will switch to named Pragya 
exit		//will switch back to Pranav if you are in Pragya, else close the terminal.
logut		//will switch back to Pranav
su - pranav	//will swtich back to Pranav
su -		//will switch to Root user

usermod -aG sudo pragya		//Pragya will also have all admin right. Not Recommanded
usermod -aG wheel pragya	//In fedora, "wheel" is the default group where admins are listed.
sudo deluser pragya sudo	//Pragya will no longer have admin right.

2. How can two user copy their files?
sudo cp /home/pragya/Pictures/cat.png  /home/pranav/Pictures	//For this pragya need have sudo group.

#

wc			//word count

ss -4				//socket status using ipv4
ss -6				//socket status using ipv6
