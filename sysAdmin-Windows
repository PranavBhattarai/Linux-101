restart-service -name <>				// E.g.:	restart-service -name firefox

[Works in Powershell. Not in "Command Prompt".]

7. Try to fix Windows 10 network issue, when its "connect to WiFi but with no internet"

netsh winsock reset	---->
netsh int ip reset	---->
ipconfig /release	---->
ipconfig /renew		--->

[For PowerShell users]
Get-NetIPAddress	// similar to "ipconfig", but much cleaner


8. Give Admin access to a user

	 net localgroup administrators <user-name> /add
example: net localgroup administrators Ashish /add

[Don't give admin access to everyone. For security reason.]

9. Show password, wifi names from terminal

netsh wlan show profile					// list all WiFi names
netsh wlan show profile = "wifi-name" key = clear	// select wifi name and show its password
netsh wlan show profile = "wifi-name" | findstr Key	// show the password only of selected wifi name

[ Quotation mark for WiFi name is Optional.]

10. Troubleshoot boot issues

 Part I:
	chkdsk /r						// r = repair
	DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth			// DISM = Deployment Image Servicing and Management 
	DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
	sfc /scannow						// SFC = System File Checker

 Part II:
	bootrec /ScanOS
	bootrec /FixMbr 
	bootrec /FixBoot 
	bootrec /RebuildBcd

[ To use DISM command is used with "/Online" parameter, you need internet connection.]

11. Launch the "Advance Startup Repair"

14. Shutdown Windows using shortkey

Alt + F4

[A dialog box appear where you can select Restart or Shutdown]

15. Activate Windows & Office package for testing:

 irm https:// massgrave . dev / get | iex	//remove space

16. Create an invisible folder in Windows		[ Trick ]

- create a folder named "con" & press Alt + 255		//  like: "con alt+255"
- change the folder icon to invisible icon

[con is one of the restricted word which users can't use to create the folder in Windows.]
[Also: Folder is selected, and is visible when the move the mouse over to it. So its not "truely invisible".]

17. Force Windows to open "Recovery Environment" to solve Boot issues:

- Power On the laptop. 
- Before Windows attempts to load (spinning dots):
	- Press Power buttom for 5-10 sec for Hard Shutdown
- Do this twice
- In 3rd time, Windows will open "Recovery Environment"

18. Get all Windows user info

get-localuser

19. Create a new user in Windows

	net user pranav * /add
or,
	net user pranav #007#007 /add /logonpasswordchg:yes	// create a new user with temporary password which need to change later

["pranav" is username and "#007#007" is the password.]

20. Delete the user profile in Windows

	net user pranav /del		// will delete Windows user named "pranav"
or
	remove-localuser pranav

[Note: If you want GUI to create and manage user, than go to Computer Management -> Local User and Groups -> Users ]

21. Force/Let Windows user to change their password when they log on:

net user pranav /logonpasswordchg:yes		//Privacy. Admin shouldn't know his emplyooees passwords.

[helpfull for new employee to create his own user password after setting up his/her PC]

22. Create a password for Windows user

	net user pranav *				//3rd person won't be above to see what you have typed
or	
	net user pranav 'write-password-here'		//3rd person can be able to see what you have typed

[first method is more cool]

23. Get information about running service using "Get-Service"

Get-Service wuauserv			//show windows update service
Get-Service usauserv | Format-List *	//see in more detailed way

Stop-Service wuauserv			//Stop running service
Start-Service wsauserv

[Run "Get-Service" to see all services that are running or stopped.]
[Also there is a GUI system app named "Services" that do same thing.]

24. How to check for disk corruption?

	wmic
	diskdrive get status		// if output is ok, then it should be fine. Else:
