1. Ramp up the speed of Windows

- Disable "SysMain" from "Services"					// feature that push 3rd party services to run automatically
- Enable "Performance mode" from "System Properties -> Advanced"	// might have to turn on "Adjust Clear Text" in some PC.
- Purge "%temp%" directory						// shortkey:	Win + R
- Disable unnecessary Startup Apps					// Task Manager -> Startup -> Select app & disable

[Note: Make sure Windows "Local Disk C" have at least 50 GB empty storage.]

2. Enable Printer sharing between PCs + Enable Network Discovery

- Open "Network sharing" ///

[Note: PCs need to be in same network in order to achieve this.]
