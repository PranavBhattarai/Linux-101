#Started from July 29, 2022. I realized maintaining secuity is REALLY important even though Linux default state is quite secure.

1. Make sure "Secure Boot" is enabled in BIOS.

	sudo mokutil --sb-state
OR,
	dmesg | grep secure

[both command will tell whether SecureBoot is enabled or disable. Enable it if its not already.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. In Windows, if you open doubtful or unknown document:

-> Never enable "Macros" if the document ask.
-> Disable Macros functionality if its enabled.

[Macros can contain scripts that can damage the OS security.]
[This primarly affects MS Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. In Windows, application shortcuts can be dangerous because:

-> Windows by default hide file extension.
-> Executable script/program icons can be changed to make it look like a picture or video to confuse.
-> Know what/which application/software/script is asking for administrative permission.

[Always check file type before running them]
